# Rocket Squids Relight
An updated port of [Rocket Squids](https://github.com/fredtargaryen/Rocket-Squids) made by barnabeepickle.

A Minecraft mod all about fire-breathing super squids!

* Rocket Squids generate uncommonly in small groups. They are capable of swimming, singing, being tickled, and occasionally blasting off at great speeds... among other things.
* The Whistling Conch is a seashell generating on beaches and the sea floor. To my knowledge, the first musical instrument item in Minecraft.
* Rare and mysterious statues can be found in the world and may contain unusual treasure.

## Information for Players and Pack Developers
The intention of the mod is to encourage exploration and experimentation. As such very little information is explicitly provided in-game.
For hints at what to do, it is best to consult [the wiki](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rocket-squids/pages/main), which provides information in sections of increasing explicitness.
If you are still not satisfied, you can peruse the source code, but prepare to be spoiled on other content.

> An updated and remastered wiki is on the TODO list.

### Compatibility with your mod
For your mod to work with Rocket Squids, add it as a dependency following the instructions [here](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/wiki/Dependencies). 

If you want the dependency to be optional, you can check if Floocraft was loaded with `Loader.isModLoaded("rocketsquids")`.

There are no plans for designing any APIs or other compatibility features but compatibility bugs or requests are welcome.

> If you want to submit pull requests for APIs they will be accepted.

### Pull Requests
With all Open Source projects Pull Requests are very much welcome
and if I'm not able to accept them you could just fork the mod yourself.
